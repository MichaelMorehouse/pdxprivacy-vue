      <span class="leadin-text">W</span>e’re working to implement
      the Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS)
      principles in the Portland Metro Area. The purpose of the
      CCOPS is to ensure transparency and public input in the
      acquisition and use of surveillance systems by law
      enforcement and to require City Council approval for all
      purchases of surveillance-related products and services.
    </p>
    <p>Our goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implement the CCOPS legislation in the Portland Metro
        Area
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The CCOPS principles are available

      <span class="leadin-text">W</span>e’re working to rein in
      the collection of user data and its use for purposes other
      than which it was shared. Most Internet companies today
      employ an advertising revenue model, where if you’re getting
      a service for free, you’re usually the product. In exchange
      for the informative or entertaining content that companies
      provide to website visitors, they collect personal
      information about those guests, such as what people read,
      what they clicked on, or what they bought. Often, this
      information is then combined with details collected
      about the users ofﬂine, such as credit card purchases
      they’ve made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some physical stores detect WiFi and/or Bluetooth signals
      emanating from customer mobile phones and use that
      information to track customers around the store, learning
      how much time they spent in each department or section of
      the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      In attempts to make our cities smarter and more
      efﬁcient, increasing amounts data will be collected in our urban
      areas. Before putting such systems in place, we need to consider the many ways that our data can
      be collected and used and must take care in protecting that
      information.
    </p>
    <p>Among other methods, individuals may be tracked via:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile phone GPS and carrier signals</li>
      <li>CCTV cameras</li>
      <li>WiFi or Bluetooth signals</li>
      <li>Sensors in sidewalks and streetlights</li>
      <li>Credit card purchases</li>
      <li>Transit passes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While these tools and techniques are not necessarily
      nefarious, without proper planning and oversight, they could
      create opportunities for misuse of personal data.

    <div class="effort-header">Biometric Privacy</div>
    <p>
      <span class="leadin-text">W</span>e’re working to get
      protections in place for biometric data. With the increased
      use of facial recognition and other systems that record body
      measurements, there must be safeguards to ensure that
      this highly personal, difﬁcult to modify data is not misused
      and is not used without our knowledge and consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of companies and government agencies have grand visions
      of how biometrics can be used to gather data and to
      streamline processes.
    </p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Department of Homeland Security working on
        streamlining transit through airports using passenger
        biometrics
      </li>
      <li>
        Some companies using facial, iris, or ﬁngerprint scans
        of employees for secure area access or timekeeping
      </li>
      <li>
        Online companies using facial recognition to identify
        persons in photos
      </li>
      <li>
        Law enforcement agencies using facial recognition to
        identify persons peacefully exercising their First
        Amendment rights
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While some uses of these technologies may be desirable, a
      face or ﬁngerprint is not easily changed like a password or
      credit card number. We need to ensure that individuals have the ability to give consent
      to having their biometric data being collected and
      to the ways the collected data will be used before data is amassed.
    </p>
    <p>Our goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bring public awareness about the gathering and use of
        biometric data
      </li>
      <li>Advocate for opt-in collection of biometric data</li>
      <li>
        Coordinate with other local groups to urge privacy and
        accountability in policy creation
      </li>
      <li>
        Pursue limits on both government and commercial usage,
        sharing, and storage of collected biometric data
      </li>
    </ul>
