      >Electronic Frontier Alliance.</a>
    </p>We believe that technology should support the intellectual freedom at
    the heart of a democratic society. In the digital age, that entails advancing:
    <ol class="principles-list">
      <li>Free Expression - People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.</li>
      <li>Security - Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.</li>
      <li>
        Privacy - Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own
        parameters about what to share with whom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creativity - Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations,
        and inventions of others.
      </li>
      <li>Access to Knowledge - Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.</p>
